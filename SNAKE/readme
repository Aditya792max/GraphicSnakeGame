The Snake Game  is a simple implementation in Java using the Swing library for the graphical user interface. Here are the key technologies we used:

Technologies:
Java:
The core programming language used for the implementation.

Java Swing Library:
Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) components such as JFrame, JPanel, and handling user input.

Classes:
App.java:
Contains the main method and initializes the game window using JFrame.
Sets up the SnakeGame instance and adds it to the JFrame.

SnakeGame.java:
Extends JPanel to create the game board and handle graphics.
Implements ActionListener to update the game state periodically.
Implements KeyListener to handle user input (arrow keys).
Contains a nested class Tile to represent individual tiles on the game board.
Manages the snake (head and body), food, game logic, and drawing.

Key Classes and Components:

JFrame:
Used to create the main window of the game.

JPanel:
Used to create the game board and handle drawing.

Timer:
Used for game loop and periodic updates.

KeyListener:
Used to handle keyboard input for controlling the snake.

ActionListener:
Used for handling actions, such as updating the game state in response to the Timer.

Random:
Used for generating random positions for placing the food.

Graphics:
Used for drawing shapes and text on the JPanel.

Additional Classes:


ArrayList:
Used to manage the body segments of the snake.
Font:
Used for setting the font for displaying the score.

Color:
Used for setting colors for drawing the snake, food, and background.

Game Logic:

Collision Detection:
Methods for detecting collisions between the snake's head, body, and the boundaries of the game board.

Movement:
Methods for updating the position of the snake's head and body.

Food Placement:
Method for placing the food at random locations on the game board.

Game Over:
Logic for determining when the game is over, either by colliding with the snake's body or reaching the board boundaries.
This Snake Game demonstrates the use of core Java programming concepts along with the Swing library for creating a simple graphical game.
